## <a name="history"></a>History

_Adaptory_ started as a prototype in February 2021.
Once a fun gameplay loop was identified,
_Stormcloak Games_ was incorporated in November 2021 to support full-time development of
Adaptory as their first title.

The [first playable Adaptory release](https://stormcloak.games/2022/04/30/first-playable-release)
was released to Patreons in April 2022, and then
[on itch.io](https://stormcloak.games/2022/10/30/download-alpha-1) in October 2022.
Regular alpha updates have since been released
every two months [for free on itch.io](https://soundasleepful.itch.io/adaptory)
and most recently [Alpha 7 in December 2023](https://stormcloak.games/2023/12/21/alpha-7).

After being part of Steam Next Fest [in February 2024](https://stormcloak.games/2024/01/28/steam-next-fest),
the team are now [working hard on content and polish](https://stormcloak.games/2024/02/14/next-fest-whats-next) for
an Early Access launch on Steam and itch.io in 2025,
with the support of [our publisher indie.io](https://stormcloak.games/2024/08/08/publisher-announcement).
The studio will continue to release regular free content updates during Early Access.
