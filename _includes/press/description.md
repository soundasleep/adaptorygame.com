## <a name="history"></a>History

_Adaptory_ started as a prototype in February 2021 by Jevon Wright.
Once the fun gameplay loop was identified,
_Stormcloak Games_ was founded in November 2021 to support full-time development of
Adapatory as their first title.

The [first playable Adaptory release](https://stormcloak.games/2022/04/30/first-playable-release)
was released to Patreons in April 2022, and regular alpha updates have been released
every two months [for free on itch.io](https://soundasleepful.itch.io/adaptory).
These alpha updates will continue until shortly before the Early Access release on Steam.

Version 1.0 of Adaptory will be [released on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2201620/Adaptory/)
and itch.io in 2024, with regular free content updates after release.
